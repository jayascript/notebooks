# Creating a Heuristic Formula to Bypass Automation

Date: January 31, 2020

Check out the **Jupyter notebook** or **PDF file** for the full analysis.

## What’s going on:

- Insurance quotes come from a database that’s automatically populated with data from ComboCompare.
- Sometimes, the database doesn’t contain a result for a quote that you need.
- Sometimes, the JavaScript front end returns bad data on its own, even if the correct result was in the database.

## What’s the goal:

- To continue to provide customers with an efficient virtual process
- To streamline the quote generation process without calling out to other applications
- To find a way to stay ahead of the curve when companies institute rate changes

## What we did:

- Pulled all of the data that was generated from the ComboCompare application into Python
- Analyzed the data and transformed the dataset so that it could be used to teach a machine learning algorithm
- Found a formula that would approximate the results returned from ComboCompare

## What was learned:

- The dataset used to find the formula will need to contain all possible combinations for insurance quotes
- The dataset will need to be analyzed thoroughly to understand how all the pieces fit together
- Many different learning algorithms (ways of teaching the machine) will need to be tried, so it can perform reasonably well no matter what data we give it

## What to be wary about:

- This system is not guaranteed to be any better than the automation, but if we choose the right algorithm and teach it in just the right way, then it’s likely to be more robust going forward
- This system will need to rely on data generated by ComboCompare to learn, so the automation won’t go away immediately, but we may be able to phase it out as we go
- This system will need a lot of training time and supervision to start, but if we put the right systems in place, then it should be able to learn on its own in the future

## What you’ll get:

- Insurance quotes come from a database that’s automatically populated with data from ComboCompare… In the future, insurance quotes will be calculated using a heuristic formula that the machine learning system developed.
- Sometimes, the database doesn’t contain a result for a quote that you need… In the future, the system may be able to give an estimate by predicting a quote, instead of returning N/A.
- Sometimes, the JavaScript front end returns bad data on its own, even if the correct result was in the database… In the future, the front end would calculate the quote using the heuristic formula, mitigating the potential downsides of calling out to the database directly.

## What’s up next:

- Develop some domain expertise to better understand how the current system works and what results you’re trying to get
- Analyze the available data and try out lots of different algorithms to determine what will create the best heuristic formula
- Figure out how to integrate this system into the current workflow
